🌟 From Figma to Pixel-Perfect Webpage – Advanced CSS Challenge
This project is all about bringing a static design to life—no shortcuts, no frameworks—just pure HTML & CSS.
It’s a full practice of layout mastery, responsive design, and fine-tuned styling to match a professional Figma mockup.

📖 The Challenge
Take a beautifully designed Figma layout and recreate it from scratch, ensuring every element feels intentional and well-placed across all screen sizes.

🔍 What I Focused On
Structure → Writing semantic HTML for accessibility and clarity.

Styling → Using modern CSS tools like Flexbox and Grid to create responsive layouts.

Details → Perfecting typography, spacing, and visual balance.

Scalability → Building with a mobile-first mindset, then scaling up for tablets and desktops.

Assets → Optimizing fonts, images, and icons for a smooth experience.
